# ScummVM Steam Link Port

This is a mostly non-functional port of ScummVM to the Steam Link. Controller
sort of works with the default analog-stick-as-mouse support built into
ScummVM, but the Steam Controller isn't working as it should with the haptic
pad as the mouse instead which would be quite nice.

## Building

You need the Steam Link SDK in order to build this. Clone
https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamlink-sdk (it's over 3GB and takes a
while!) and run `source setenv.sh` while in the SDK root directory. Then enter
the ScummVM source tree and run `./build_steamlink.sh`.

To install, place `scummvm.tgz` onto a FAT32 formatted USB disk in
`steamlink/apps/scummvm`. Place the USB disk into your Steam Link, unplug the
power cable from the Link and then plug it back in. This copies the app to the
filesystem on the Steam Link so you can trash the disk afterwards if you like.

You can pass additional `./configure` options while invoking the script, such
as `./build_steamlink.sh --disable-all-engines`.

Alternatively you can enable SSH on the Steam Link (see the SDK documentation)
and scp it (uncompressed) directly to /home/apps/scummvm.

## Changes

I'm a noob so there are no actual code changes here, just a `steamlink` host
assigned in `configure`. Fine tuning the correct options here may or may not be
necessary for better performance (but it already performs pretty well as it
is).

Please fork and continue development if you'd like to get the Steam Controller
working.

## Credits and whatever else

GPLv2 as per original ScummVM, but there aren't likely to be any future changes
to this repo so I don't consider it a real 'fork' anyway.

Big thanks to GranPC for pointing me in the right direction and answering my
pathetic questions about SDKs even work.
